        <img src="https://oaklandnorth.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Photo_1-600x400.jpg">
        <p class="memer">Eric Nguyen is a ninth-grader at <a href="https://oaklandtech.com/staff" target= "_blank">Oakland Technical High School!</a></p>
        <p class="destroyer">Occasionally, on his free time, he will like to "make stuff" and play random people games on the internet. He thinks that games are weak.</p>
        <p class="chairer">Here are his favorite movies:
            <ol>
                <li>The Interview</li>
                <li>The Giver</li>
                <li>Rear Window</li>
                <li>Titanic</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="panter">His favorite musician is his Spotify, but that is not a person, so yeah.
        </p>
        <p class="panter">In ten years, he sees himself working at a fast food place.
        </p>
        <p class="panter">His favorite colors are magenta and plum.</p>
